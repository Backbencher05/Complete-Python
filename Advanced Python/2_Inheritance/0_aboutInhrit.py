"""
One of the core concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) languages is inheritance. It is a mechanism that allows you to create a hierarchy of classes that share a set of properties and methods by deriving a class from another class.
Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class.

Benefits of inheritance are:

Inheritance allows you to inherit the properties of a class, i.e., base class to another, i.e., derived class. The benefits of Inheritance in Python are as follows:

- It represents real-world relationships well.
- It provides the reusability of a code. We donâ€™t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.
- It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.
- Inheritance offers a simple, understandable model structure. 
- Less development and maintenance expenses result from an inheritance.

# How to achieve

# Using members of one class inside another class:

# We can use members of one class inside another class by using the following ways

# 1. By Composition (Has-A Relationship)
# 2. By Inheritance (IS-A Relationship)
