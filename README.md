Multi Threading
    - Multi tasking
      2 types of Multi Tasking
      - Process based Multi Tasking (operating system level.)
      - Thread based Multi Tasking (programmatic level.)
      
    - The ways of Creating Thread in Python
      We can create a thread in Python by using 3 ways
      1. Creating a Thread without using any class
      2. Creating a Thread by extending Thread class
      3. Creating a Thread without extending Thread class

    - Threadig Functions
       1:Setting and Getting Name of a Thread
       2: Thread Identification Number (ident)
       3: active_count()
       4: enumerate() function:
       5: isAlive()
       6: join() method
    
    - Daemon Threads
