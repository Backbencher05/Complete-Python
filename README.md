  - About Polymorphism
  Related to polymorphism the following 4 topics are important
  - Duck Typing Philosophy of Python
  - Overloading
     - Operator Overloading
     - Method Overloading
     - Constructor Overloading

Python OOPs Part-4
  

Multi Threading
  - Multi tasking
      2 types of Multi Tasking
      - Process based Multi Tasking (operating system level.)
      - Thread based Multi Tasking (programmatic level.)
      
  - The ways of Creating Thread in Python
      We can create a thread in Python by using 3 ways
      1. Creating a Thread without using any class
      2. Creating a Thread by extending Thread class
      3. Creating a Thread without extending Thread class

  - Threadig Functions
     1. Setting and Getting Name of a Thread
     2. Thread Identification Number (ident)
     3. active_count()
     4. enumerate() function:
     5. isAlive()
     6. join() method
    
  - Daemon Threads
  - Synchronizations
